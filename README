LightRobotRemoteControl-App Readme file

The App is tested and has been used only on a HTC-Desire, means there is no guarantee that this will work on other Android-Devices as it should!

There are three different ways to control the Robot:

-> There are several buttons, sliders and other control elements to control the robot with Touch-Input.

-> The color mode (shine, blink, shine randomly, blink randomly) and the colours (red, green, blue) can also be set with voice input (using google voice recognition).

-> The movement of the LightRobot can be controlled with the accelerometer-sensor of the smartphone, makes a lot of fun.

Further documentation of the used protocoll to communicate with the robot is documented in the code.
